# List keys

    gpg2 -k some@email.org # list public keys
    gpg2 -K                # list secret keys

# User id and key id

    The user id (UID) is just the name of the user. When editing key or encrypting files,
    the name can be partically matched (i.e. type "Ma" to match "Marlin").
    And email can also be used to identify the uid.
    See: https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Specify-a-User-ID.html

    The key id (KID) can be acquired from `gpg2 --list-keys`,


# Edit the key, e.g. add an uid

    gpg2 --edit-key

# Sign(-s), Encrypt(-e), Symmetric(-c), Clearsign, Detach-sign and Decrypt(-d), Verify

  --sign, --encrypt and --symmetric can be combined with each one.
    o sign + encrypt:      for a signed and encrypted message
    o sign + symmetric:    for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message
    o encrypt + symmetric: for a message that may be decrypted via a secret key *or* a passphrase
    o three together:      for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key *or* a passphrase

  Use --throw-keyids to hide receivers

# Export public key

    gpg2 --export --armor
